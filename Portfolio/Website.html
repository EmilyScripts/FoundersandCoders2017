		<h2>How I Got Into Programming</h2>
		<p>My journey into programming is a relatively new one. In August I was looking into finding a new hobby or activity that would spark my interest. After looking at a few options but nothing really sparking my interest, I looked into coding and had a lookover at the subreddit /r/learnprogramming. After reading up a bit about it, I decided to look at some of the recommeneded resources for beginners, which led me to FreeCodeCamp. From here I instantly knew that this was what I was going to take up, the small exercise bites gave me lots of oppotunities for problem solving and became a highly enjoyable and rewarding experience. While doing a bit of the HTML and CSS course, I decided to look up more information about programming as a whole and find some books to read on the subject. It was here I realised how muc hcreativity there was in programming and I soon after realised that this was something I was serious about and began looking at courses that were on offer that could help with my learning process.

		<p>While looking around for programming courses located in London, one thing became immediately clear, I was going to need to find a sudden influx of cash. I desperately wanted to go to a face to face course but every course I looked at was massively too expensive. Here, I started to instead look at online courses that were recommended on Udemy so I started The Web Developer Bootcamp. This further clarified that I was serious about programming so I checked to see if there were any cheaper evening courses I could aim to apply for. It was this that lead me to an article by The Guardian about Founders and Coders.
